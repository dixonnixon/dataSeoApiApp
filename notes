Task Desctiption:
  """
  We are seeking a skilled professional to assist us in extracting data from a comprehensive database via an API and transforming this data into a usable format for our team. The database contains over 100 million records of Google Maps data, each with approximately 20 data points. Our goal is to pull data based on specific criteria (e.g., category) and make it accessible through Google Sheets or, preferably, as a CSV download.

Key Responsibilities:
- Set up API calls to the DataForSEO API (Documentation: https://docs.dataforseo.com/v3/databases/business_listings/) to retrieve data based on specific parameters such as category.
- Filter and transform the data to include only the necessary data points, such as name, website URL, and category.
- Implement a solution that enables the data to be exported directly into Google Sheets or as a downloadable CSV file.
- Ensure the solution is user-friendly and can be operated by our team without requiring technical expertise for each use.
- Provide documentation and training materials for our team on how to use the implemented solution.

Requirements:
- [] Proven experience with API integration and data manipulation.
- [] Experience with Google Sheets API and/or creating CSV files programmatically.

Please include in your proposal:
- Your approach to this project and any tools or technologies you plan to use.
- Estimated time to completion.
